    "# 2. What Is Language?\n",

    "characters, words, sentences, etc. \\\n",
    "We can think of human language as composed of four major building\n",

    "### PHONEMES\n",
    "Phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language. They may not\n",
    "have any meaning by themselves but can induce meanings when uttered\n",
    "in combination with other phonemes. For example, standard English\n",
    "has 44 phonemes, which are either single letters or a combination of\n",
    "letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MORPHEMES AND LEXEMES\n",
    "A morpheme is the smallest unit of language that has a meaning. It is\n",
    "formed by a combination of phonemes. Not all morphemes are words,\n",
    "but all prefixes and suffixes are morphemes. For example, in the word\n",
    "“multimedia,” “multi-” is not a word but a prefix that changes the\n",
    "meaning when put together with “media.” “Multi-” is a morpheme.\n",
    "\n",

    "Syntax is a set of rules to construct grammatically correct sentences out\n",
    "of words and phrases in a language. Syntactic structure in linguistics is\n",
    "represented in many different ways. A common approach to\n",
    "representing sentences is a parse tree.\n",

    "### CONTEXT\n",
    "Context is how various parts in a language come together to convey a\n",
    "particular meaning. Context includes long-term references, world\n",
    "knowledge, and common sense along with the literal meaning of words\n",
    "and phrases. The meaning of a sentence can change based on the\n",

    "## Why Is NLP Challenging?\n",
    "\n",
    "### AMBIGUITY\n",
    "Ambiguity means uncertainty of meaning. Most human languages are\n",
    "inherently ambiguous. Consider the following sentence: “I made her\n",
    "duck.” This sentence has multiple meanings. The first one is: I cooked\n",
    "a duck for her. The second meaning is: I made her bend down to avoid\n",
    "an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### COMMON KNOWLEDGE\n",
    "A key aspect of any human language is “common knowledge.” It is the\n",
    "set of all facts that most humans are aware of. In any conversation, it is\n",
    "assumed that these facts are known, hence they’re not explicitly\n",
    "mentioned, but they do have a bearing on the meaning of the sentence.\n",
    "For example, consider two sentences: “man bit dog” and “dog bit\n",
    "man.” We all know that the first sentence is unlikely to happen, while\n",
    "the second one is very possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CREATIVITY\n",
    "Language is not just rule driven; there is also a creative aspect to it.\n",
    "Various styles, dialects, genres, and variations are used in any\n",
    "language. Poems are a great example of creativity in language. \n",
    "\n",
    "### DIVERSITY ACROSS LANGUAGES\n",
    "For most languages in the world, there is no direct mapping between\n",
    "the vocabularies of any two languages. This makes porting an NLP\n",
    "solution from one language to another hard."
